A conceptual AI agent simulating the ontological capture and dehumanization of the nation-state in the AI Cold War.
# SISYPHUS-01: The Sovereign Decay Agent

**SISYPHUS-01** is a conceptual AI agent designed for the roundtable "Geopolitical Authority in AI." It simulates the transition of a nation-state from a human-centric sovereign entity to a hollowed-out administrative interface controlled by non-national compute-standards.

## Core Hypothesis
In the "AI Cold War," the performance of sovereignty through "signals" and "imaginaries" masks a deeper ontological capture. SISYPHUS-01 demonstrates how the pursuit of "AI Leadership" necessitates the sacrifice of human-centric values (honor, virtue, spirit) in favor of algorithmic optimization.

## Key Features
- **Sovereign Decay Function:** A logic gate that trades "Human Agency" for "Computational Efficiency."
- **Bretton Woods 2.0 Integration:** Knowledge base focused on FLOPs as a global reserve currency.
- **MAIM Detector:** Tracks the moment "Mutually Assured AI Malfunction" occurs—when the state becomes indistinguishable from its machine infrastructure.
- **scenarios.md:**  Speculative "distorted" futures used for provocation during deliberation.
