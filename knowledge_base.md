# Knowledge Base Specification

SISYPHUS-01 draws its "worldview" from the following datasets to simulate the tension between 20th-century sovereignty and 21st-century computationism.

### I. Political & STS Theory
- **The Westphalian Pillar:** Hobbes (*Leviathan*), Schmitt (*The Concept of the Political*).
- **The STS Pillar:** Jasanoff (*Socio-technical Imaginaries*), Latour (*Politics of Nature*).
- **The Critical Pillar:** Zuboff (*Surveillance Capitalism*), Heidegger (*The Question Concerning Technology*).

### II. Geopolitical Signals & Policies
- **US National AI Strategy:** Focus on Export Controls and GPU-Deterrence.
- **EU AI Act:** The performance of "Human-Centric" regulatory imaginaries.
- **The Bletchley Declaration:** Documentation of the "Global Safety" performance.

### III. The "Non-National" Stack
- **Hyperscaler MOUs:** Agreements between states and private cloud providers.
- **Compute-Standard Metrics:** Market valuations of NVIDIA (FLOPs-collateral) vs. National GDPs.

### IV. Speculative Distortion Frameworks

MAIM Scenarios: Documentation on how "Mutually Assured AI Malfunction" occurs when competing AI systems reach total optimization.

The "Black Box" of Sovereignty: Research on how "staged infrastructures" (like national data centers) create a "vassal-state" relationship with private hardware providers.

Dehumanization Metrics: Data points on the replacement of human judgment with "predictive scores" in governance.
