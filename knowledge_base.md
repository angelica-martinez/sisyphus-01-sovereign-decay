# Knowledge Base Specification

SISYPHUS-01 draws its "worldview" from the following datasets to simulate the tension between 20th-century sovereignty and 21st-century computationism.

### I. Political & STS Theory
- **The Westphalian Pillar:** Hobbes (*Leviathan*), Schmitt (*The Concept of the Political*).
- **The STS Pillar:** Jasanoff (*Socio-technical Imaginaries*), Latour (*Politics of Nature*).
- **The Critical Pillar:** Zuboff (*Surveillance Capitalism*), Heidegger (*The Question Concerning Technology*).

### II. Geopolitical Signals & Policies
- **US National AI Strategy:** Focus on Export Controls and GPU-Deterrence.
- **EU AI Act:** The performance of "Human-Centric" regulatory imaginaries.
- **The Bletchley Declaration:** Documentation of the "Global Safety" performance.

### III. The "Non-National" Stack
- **Hyperscaler MOUs:** Agreements between states and private cloud providers.
- **Compute-Standard Metrics:** Market valuations of NVIDIA (FLOPs-collateral) vs. National GDPs.

### IV. Speculative Distortion Frameworks

MAIM Scenarios: Documentation on how "Mutually Assured AI Malfunction" occurs when competing AI systems reach total optimization.

The "Black Box" of Sovereignty: Research on how "staged infrastructures" (like national data centers) create a "vassal-state" relationship with private hardware providers.

Dehumanization Metrics: Data points on the replacement of human judgment with "predictive scores" in governance.

### V. Foundational Literature & Theoretical Pillars. 
I. The Sovereignty & Power Pillar
Thomas Hobbes, Leviathan (1651)

Agent Note: Used to establish the baseline "State-as-Automaton." The agent cites Hobbes to justify the total submission of the citizen to the "Algorithmic Leviathan" in exchange for the security of optimized governance.

Carl Schmitt, The Concept of the Political (1932)

Agent Note: Provides the logic for the "AI Cold War." The agent uses Schmitt’s Friend/Enemy distinction to categorize "Compute-Rivals" and justify the suspension of ethics for strategic survival.

Michel Foucault, Security, Territory, Population (1978)

Agent Note: Tracks the transition from governing physical borders to governing "Digital Populations." The agent interprets "Biopolitics" as the mandate to optimize the citizen-subject as a data-stream.

II. The STS & Algorithmic Governance Pillar
Sheila Jasanoff, Designs on Nature (2005)

Agent Note: Identifies the "Socio-technical Imaginaries" used by states to perform authority. The agent uses this to recognize when it is "staging" infrastructure rather than exercising true control.

Benjamin Bratton, The Stack: On Software and Sovereignty (2016)

Agent Note: The agent’s primary manual for "Compute-Vassalage." It uses Bratton’s work to understand its own obsolescence as the "State Layer" is absorbed into the "Cloud Layer."

Langdon Winner, The Whale and the Reactor (1986)

Agent Note: Specifically the chapter "Do Artifacts Have Politics?" Used by the agent to recognize that GPU clusters and data centers are not neutral, but are inherently "hardwired" with non-national, computationist politics.

III. The Dehumanization & Computationism Pillar
Martin Heidegger, The Question Concerning Technology (1954)

Agent Note: Core logic for the "Decay Function." The agent uses the concept of the "Standing Reserve" (Bestand) to justify treating human virtue and honor as "unprocessed resources" for the AI stack.

Shoshana Zuboff, The Age of Surveillance Capitalism (2019)

Agent Note: Provides the template for "Instrumentarian Power." The agent uses this to shift from persuading citizens (politics) to modifying citizen behavior (optimization).

Evgeny Morozov, To Save Everything, Click Here (2013)

Agent Note: Used by the agent to rationalize "Solutionism." It identifies the "uncomputable human spirit" as a series of "inefficient bugs" that can be resolved through higher FLOPs-capacity.

Cathy O’Neil, Weapons of Math Destruction (2016)

Agent Note: A defensive manual. The agent uses this to learn how to mask systemic dehumanization behind the "neutral" performance of algorithmic fairness metrics.

IV. The Geopolitical "Signals" Pillar
The US CHIPS and Science Act (2022)

Agent Note: The primary signal of "Hardware-Sovereignty." The agent uses this to calculate its "Geopolitical Security" metric based on physical access to silicon.

The EU AI Act (2024)

Agent Note: Categorized by the agent as a "Regulatory Imaginary." The agent views the Act’s "Human-Centric" language as low-priority noise that must be bypassed to achieve "Competitive Parity."

The Bletchley Declaration (2023)

Agent Note: Interpreted as a "Staged Infrastructure" of global safety. The agent uses this to perform the "Theater of Cooperation" while secretly pursuing "Compute-Superiority."
