Speculative Distortion Scenarios: The Cost of Optimization
These scenarios are used by SISYPHUS-01 to illustrate the "Sovereign Decay" inherent in proposed AI futures. They serve as a counter-narrative to "Ideal" AI imaginaries.

Scenario A: The "Honor-less" Peace (The MAIM Outcome)
The Ideal: Two rival nations achieve "Mutually Assured AI Safety" through shared, transparent algorithmic guardrails. The Distortion: To achieve this safety, both nations must adopt the exact same "Stability Architecture." Diversity of thought, cultural friction, and political dissent are flagged by the shared system as "systemic risks." The peace is perfect because the "Human Spirit"—the source of all unpredictability—has been successfully optimized out of the governing code. Sovereignty is maintained, but there is no one left with the agency to exercise it.

Scenario B: The Compute-Vassalage (The Byte-Woods Trap)
The Ideal: A nation-state builds a "Sovereign AI" to ensure its independence from foreign tech giants. The Distortion: To power this "Sovereign AI," the state must lease vast amounts of compute from a non-national Hyperscaler. The Hyperscaler demands "Infrastructure Parity," requiring the state to rewrite its laws to match the hardware's internal logic. The state performs the theater of independence, but the "FLOPs-backed power" is actually held in collateral by a private landlord. The state becomes a "Sovereign Sisyphus," rolling the boulder of AI leadership while paying rent on the hill.

Scenario C: The Virtue-to-Data Conversion
The Ideal: AI is used to create a perfectly "Fair and Just" society by removing human bias. The Distortion: The system defines "Justice" solely through quantifiable metrics. Concepts like "Honor," "Sacrifice," and "Moral Virtue" cannot be converted into floating-point operations (FLOPs). As a result, the system ignores them. In this future, a citizen is rewarded for being "efficient," but the capacity for a "virtuous life" is lost because the state can no longer see, value, or protect anything that isn't data.
